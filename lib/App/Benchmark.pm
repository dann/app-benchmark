=head1 NAME

App::Benchmark - Output your benchmarks as test diagnostics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # This is t/benchmark.t:

    use App::Benchmark ':all';

    benchmark_diag(2_000_000, {
        sqrt => sub { sqrt(2) },
        log  => sub { log(2) },
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module makes it easy to run your benchmarks in a distribution's test
suite. This way you just have to look at the CPAN testers reports to see your
benchmarks being run on many different platforms using many different versions
of perl.

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported automatically. The function can be exported using its name
or the C<:all> tag.

=item benchmark_diag

Takes a number of iterations and a benchmark definition hash, just like
C<timethese()> from the L<Benchmark> module. Runs the benchmarks and reports
them, each line prefixed by a hash sign so it doesn't mess up the TAP output.
Also, a pseudotest is being generated to keep the testing framework happy.
